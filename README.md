### **Design Choices**

#### Fonts

Considering the targeted audience, a sans serif font is best because it is often 
associated to simplicity, modern and clean design. It is as well a flexible font that 
can be pair with the serif style for more formal intention and traditional feel.  
The website will use ***Proza Libre*** font because it has been designed to work 
very well on screen. It will be paired with the ***Cormorant Garmont*** font because 
as [Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/blog/google-fonts-combinations) says :
>both designs have a strong calligraphic feel that ties them together.


#### Icons

* Fontawesome icons will be used for better user experience.
* The [logo](assets/images/logo.png) and [favicon](assets/images/favicon.ico) are the same image for comfort and consistency and use 
the same color scheme as the website.

#### Colors

The [color scheme](assets/images/colors.png) of the website has been extracted from a picture using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image) 
and swatches are said to be color blind safe by the same website using the [accessibility tool](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility).  
The colors use are as follow : #84A9D9 / #C4DDF2 / #717334 / #736640 / #BF9075.
An Orange shade (#C7530F) is used for links. A off white (#FAFAFA) is used for font color. They are distinctive and with a good contrast.

#### Images

The hero image is important for the UX and is large, open and trigger the will to explore the website.  
A gallery page is part of the website. There will be pictures of scenery, paths and walks in general.

#### Styling and Feeling

The home page is design to give the feeling of grandiose and adventure.  
The general feel of the website is the love of the outdoor and as well the love 
of sharing moments. This is brought by a simple and clean user interface with 
a lot of space.

#### Audio and Video

A few short video will be included in the gallery.

## Local Deployment

### Cloning

When a reporitory is created on GitHub, it is located on GitHub website ("remotely"). 
You can create a copy of the repository locally on your machine. This 
process is called : "**Cloning a repository**".  
When cloning a repository you are actually copying all the data that the repository 
contains at that time to your machine.

To clone a repository, take the following steps :

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Click on the **Code** dropdown button above the files list.
3. There are three options available to clone the repository :
    * using HTTPS
    * using SSH key
    * using GitHub CLI  

![clone otions](assets/images/cloning.png)

4. Choose an option and copy the link given.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
5. Open your IDE and in the CLI type : ```git clone``` and paste the link copied on step 4.
>```$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY```     
6. Press **Enter** to create your local clone.

For further informations please go to [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-using-the-command-line).


### Using GitPod

To Clone a repository Using GitPod, take the following steps :

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Intall the Gitpod [extention](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) for Chrome or [Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/gitpod/) for Firefox.
3. Navigate to the corresponding repository.
4. Click ont the **Gitpod** button on the top right of the files list.
5. This will open a workspace on GitPod where you can work on the repository locally.

>The very first time that you do this, you need to connect Gitpod and GitHub together.
You need to log in with GitHub and launch your workspace (As explain above). And then you need to
authorize Gitpod to be able to access your GitHub account. You agree to Gitpod's
terms and conditions, and then create a free account. Then, it will open the
workspace for you.

by Matt Rudge. 

### Using GitHub Desktop

An other option is available : GitHub Desktop. It consist of cloning a repository from GitHub 
to GitHub Desktop.  
For full informations about how to use this option, please visit [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop).

### Forking

Forking a repository will copy it in your own repositories in GitHub.

>A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. 
Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream 
repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork 
synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.

To Fork a repository take the following steps :

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Navigate to the corresponding repository.
3. Identify the ```fork``` button on the top right of the page and click on it.

4. Now you should find a copy of the repository in ```Your repositories```.


# Bugs
Issue : We Cannot see the toggle icon.
Solve : The navigation bar require Bootstrap color scheme.

Issue : Position the navigation menu to the right.
Solve : The parent of the <ul> should have the class="justify-content-end".

Issue : When the navigation menu is toggled and clicked on, the list of links of the menu doesn't appear.
Solve : JQuery script was missing before the </body>. I was using a Beta version of Bootstrap that didn't include it.

Issue : Whe can see the "Current page." message provided in the span with class="sr-only" that goes with the active link.
Solve : The "sr-only" class goes with aria-hidden attribute.

Issue : The callout button of the hone page is not aligned with the the copyright text.
Solve :

Issue : The middle column in activities.html show a gap on very large screens and is not horizontally centered on medium screens.
Solve : Add some extra padding-left to the div that wrap the content to fix the gap. Add an extra classe "col-sm-8" to better fit with the content 
so that the column is centered horizontally.
